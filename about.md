## About this site

Hi! I'm Vicente Romero. This is my personal website, where I keep a summary of what I have built over the years, mostly in my spare time. I also write (not very often though) about anything that I may find interesting or useful/valuable for other people and specially for myself. The topics that I usually write about are: programming, compression, mathematics or game development.
